            <h2>More info</h2>
            <p>Sustainable Development Goal 7 (SDG 7) aims to ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all. Energy is central to nearly every major challenge and opportunity the world faces today, from the availability of jobs to security concerns, climate change, food production, and increasing incomes.</p>
            <p>SDG 7 targets include ensuring universal access to affordable, reliable, and modern energy services, increasing the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix, and improving energy efficiency.</p>
            <p>Significant progress has been made in increasing access to electricity and improving energy efficiency. However, challenges such as reliance on fossil fuels, inadequate infrastructure, and disparities in energy access persist. These issues are particularly pronounced in developing countries and rural areas.</p>
            <p>Addressing these challenges requires a comprehensive approach that includes investing in renewable energy infrastructure, promoting energy efficiency practices, supporting research and development in clean energy technologies, and ensuring equitable access to energy services. Collaboration among governments, international organizations, civil society, and the private sector is essential for achieving SDG 7.</p>
