            <p>Sustainable Development Goal 3 (SDG 3) aims to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages. This goal is critical for sustainable development, as healthy populations are essential for economic growth and societal stability.</p>
            <p>SDG 3 targets a range of health priorities, including reducing maternal and child mortality, combating communicable diseases, reducing non-communicable diseases, promoting mental health, and ensuring universal health coverage. Achieving these targets requires coordinated efforts and investment in health systems, infrastructure, and services.</p>
            <p>Progress has been made in many areas, such as increasing life expectancy, reducing child and maternal mortality, and improving access to clean water and sanitation. However, challenges such as emerging diseases, health inequities, and inadequate healthcare systems persist.</p>
            <p>Addressing these challenges requires a multifaceted approach, including strengthening health systems, enhancing health education, promoting healthy lifestyles, and ensuring equitable access to quality healthcare services. Collaboration among governments, international organizations, civil society, and the private sector is essential for achieving SDG 3.</p>
