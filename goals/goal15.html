            <h2>More info</h2>
            <p>Sustainable Development Goal 15 (SDG 15) aims to protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss. Forests cover 30 percent of the Earth’s surface and provide vital habitats for millions of species, as well as livelihoods for human beings. Land degradation, deforestation, and biodiversity loss threaten our well-being and survival.</p>
            <p>SDG 15 targets include ensuring the conservation, restoration, and sustainable use of terrestrial and inland freshwater ecosystems and their services, sustainably managing forests, combating desertification, and halting and reversing land degradation and biodiversity loss.</p>
            <p>Significant progress has been made in raising awareness about the importance of terrestrial ecosystems and implementing measures to protect and restore them. However, challenges such as deforestation, habitat destruction, and species extinction persist, particularly in regions with high levels of poverty and population growth.</p>
            <p>Addressing these challenges requires a comprehensive approach that includes promoting sustainable land use practices, protecting natural habitats, restoring degraded land, and ensuring that terrestrial ecosystem conservation is integrated into national policies and strategies. Collaboration among governments, international organizations, civil society, and the private sector is essential for achieving SDG 15.</p>
