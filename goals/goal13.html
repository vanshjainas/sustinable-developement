            <h2>More info</h2>
            <p>Sustainable Development Goal 13 (SDG 13) aims to take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts. Climate change is affecting every country on every continent. It is disrupting national economies and affecting lives, costing people, communities, and countries dearly today and even more tomorrow.</p>
            <p>SDG 13 targets include strengthening resilience and adaptive capacity to climate-related hazards and natural disasters in all countries, integrating climate change measures into national policies, strategies, and planning, and improving education, awareness-raising, and human and institutional capacity on climate change mitigation, adaptation, impact reduction, and early warning.</p>
            <p>Significant progress has been made in increasing awareness and action on climate change. However, challenges such as rising global temperatures, extreme weather events, and greenhouse gas emissions persist, particularly in developing countries and among vulnerable populations.</p>
            <p>Addressing these challenges requires a comprehensive approach that includes reducing greenhouse gas emissions, promoting renewable energy, supporting climate resilience and adaptation efforts, and ensuring that climate action is integrated into national policies and strategies. Collaboration among governments, international organizations, civil society, and the private sector is essential for achieving SDG 13.</p>
