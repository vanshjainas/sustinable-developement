            <h2>More info</h2>
            <p>Sustainable Development Goal 17 (SDG 17) aims to strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the global partnership for sustainable development. Achieving the SDGs requires strong global partnerships and cooperation among governments, the private sector, civil society, and other stakeholders.</p>
            <p>SDG 17 targets include enhancing international cooperation to facilitate access to technology and knowledge, promoting a universal, rules-based, open, non-discriminatory, and equitable multilateral trading system, and significantly increasing the exports of developing countries.</p>
            <p>Significant progress has been made in fostering global partnerships for sustainable development, with many countries and organizations working together to achieve the SDGs. However, challenges such as unequal access to resources, technology, and finance persist, particularly in developing countries.</p>
            <p>Addressing these challenges requires a comprehensive approach that includes promoting technology transfer, enhancing capacity-building efforts, ensuring policy coherence, and mobilizing financial resources from various sources. Collaboration among governments, international organizations, civil society, and the private sector is essential for achieving SDG 17.</p>
