            <h2>More info</h2>
            <p>Sustainable Development Goal 14 (SDG 14) aims to conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas, and marine resources for sustainable development. The oceans are our planet's life support system, regulating the climate and providing a habitat for countless species. Protecting marine ecosystems is vital for the health of the planet and human well-being.</p>
            <p>SDG 14 targets include preventing and reducing marine pollution, sustainably managing and protecting marine and coastal ecosystems, minimizing and addressing the impacts of ocean acidification, regulating harvesting, and ending overfishing, illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing, and destructive fishing practices.</p>
            <p>Significant progress has been made in raising awareness about marine conservation and implementing measures to protect marine ecosystems. However, challenges such as marine pollution, overfishing, and habitat destruction persist, particularly in coastal areas and among vulnerable communities.</p>
            <p>Addressing these challenges requires a comprehensive approach that includes reducing pollution, promoting sustainable fishing practices, protecting marine habitats, and ensuring that marine conservation is integrated into national policies and strategies. Collaboration among governments, international organizations, civil society, and the private sector is essential for achieving SDG 14.</p>
