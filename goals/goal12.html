            <h2>More info</h2>
            <p>Sustainable Development Goal 12 (SDG 12) aims to ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns. This goal is crucial for reducing our ecological footprint and ensuring that future generations can meet their needs.</p>
            <p>SDG 12 targets include achieving the sustainable management and efficient use of natural resources, reducing waste generation through prevention, reduction, recycling, and reuse, and encouraging companies to adopt sustainable practices and integrate sustainability information into their reporting cycle.</p>
            <p>Significant progress has been made in promoting responsible consumption and production. However, challenges such as excessive waste generation, resource depletion, and unsustainable consumption patterns persist, particularly in developed countries.</p>
            <p>Addressing these challenges requires a comprehensive approach that includes promoting sustainable resource management, supporting sustainable business practices, encouraging consumer awareness and education, and implementing policies that support sustainable consumption and production. Collaboration among governments, international organizations, civil society, and the private sector is essential for achieving SDG 12.</p>
