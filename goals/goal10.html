            <h2>More info</h2>
            <p>Sustainable Development Goal 10 (SDG 10) aims to reduce inequality within and among countries. Inequality threatens long-term social and economic development, harms poverty reduction, and destroys people’s sense of fulfillment and self-worth.</p>
            <p>SDG 10 targets include progressively achieving and sustaining income growth of the bottom 40% of the population at a rate higher than the national average, empowering and promoting the social, economic, and political inclusion of all, and ensuring equal opportunity and reducing inequalities of outcome.</p>
            <p>Significant progress has been made in reducing inequality. However, challenges such as income disparity, unequal access to education and healthcare, and discrimination persist, particularly in developing countries and among marginalized groups.</p>
            <p>Addressing these challenges requires a comprehensive approach that includes promoting equal opportunities, supporting disadvantaged communities, ensuring inclusive economic policies, and addressing systemic barriers to equality. Collaboration among governments, international organizations, civil society, and the private sector is essential for achieving SDG 10.</p>
