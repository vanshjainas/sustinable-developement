            <h2>More info</h2>
            <p>Sustainable Development Goal 4 (SDG 4) aims to ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all. Education is essential for achieving many other sustainable development goals, as it provides individuals with the skills and knowledge needed to participate fully in society and the economy.</p>
            <p>SDG 4 targets cover various aspects of education, including early childhood education, primary and secondary education, vocational training, and higher education. It also emphasizes the importance of gender equality, quality of education, and lifelong learning opportunities.</p>
            <p>Significant progress has been made in increasing access to education, particularly for girls and marginalized groups. However, challenges such as inadequate infrastructure, insufficient trained teachers, and disparities in education quality persist.</p>
            <p>Addressing these challenges requires a comprehensive approach that includes improving educational infrastructure, providing training and support for teachers, promoting inclusive education practices, and ensuring equitable access to quality education for all students. Collaboration among governments, international organizations, civil society, and the private sector is crucial for achieving SDG 4.</p>
