            <h2>More info</h2>
            <p>Sustainable Development Goal 11 (SDG 11) aims to make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable. Urbanization offers significant opportunities for economic growth and human development. However, rapid urbanization also presents challenges, such as the strain on infrastructure, housing, and the environment.</p>
            <p>SDG 11 targets include ensuring access for all to adequate, safe, and affordable housing and basic services, providing access to safe, affordable, accessible, and sustainable transport systems for all, and enhancing inclusive and sustainable urbanization and capacity for participatory, integrated, and sustainable human settlement planning and management.</p>
            <p>Significant progress has been made in improving urban infrastructure and housing. However, challenges such as inadequate infrastructure, poor housing conditions, and environmental degradation persist, particularly in developing countries and among marginalized communities.</p>
            <p>Addressing these challenges requires a comprehensive approach that includes investing in urban infrastructure, supporting affordable housing, promoting sustainable transport, and ensuring inclusive urban planning and management. Collaboration among governments, international organizations, civil society, and the private sector is essential for achieving SDG 11.</p>
