            <h2>More info</h2>
            <p>Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6) aims to ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all. Access to clean water and sanitation is fundamental to health and well-being, and critical for the development of society and the preservation of the environment.</p>
            <p>SDG 6 targets include achieving universal access to safe and affordable drinking water, providing access to adequate and equitable sanitation and hygiene for all, improving water quality by reducing pollution, and ensuring sustainable water management and efficient use of water resources.</p>
            <p>Significant progress has been made in providing access to clean water and sanitation, but challenges such as water scarcity, pollution, and inadequate infrastructure persist. These issues disproportionately affect the poorest and most vulnerable populations.</p>
            <p>Addressing these challenges requires a comprehensive approach that includes investing in water infrastructure, promoting water conservation practices, improving water quality, and ensuring equitable access to water and sanitation services. Collaboration among governments, international organizations, civil society, and the private sector is essential for achieving SDG 6.</p>
