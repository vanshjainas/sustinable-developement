            <h2>More info</h2>
            <p>Sustainable Development Goal 5 (SDG 5) aims to achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls. Gender equality is crucial for sustainable development, as it impacts all areas of society, from health and education to economic growth and environmental sustainability.</p>
            <p>SDG 5 targets various aspects of gender equality, including eliminating all forms of discrimination, violence, and harmful practices against women and girls, ensuring equal opportunities for leadership, and promoting access to reproductive health and rights.</p>
            <p>Significant progress has been made in improving gender equality, such as increased participation of women in leadership roles and reduced gender gaps in education. However, challenges such as gender-based violence, unequal access to resources, and discriminatory practices persist.</p>
            <p>Addressing these challenges requires a comprehensive approach that includes legal reforms, education and awareness campaigns, economic empowerment programs, and support services for survivors of violence. Collaboration among governments, international organizations, civil society, and the private sector is essential for achieving SDG 5.</p>
